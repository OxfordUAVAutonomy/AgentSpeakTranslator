# AgentSpeakTranslator

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.18572.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18572)

A prototype translator from AgentSpeak to C.

For more information, see [here](http://www.cprover.org/UAVs/TAROS2015/).

**Important:** This translator was created as a prototype/proof-of-concept. Many features are missing or experimental and specifications may change significantly in the course of development.

## Installation and Usage

In order to install the translator, please use the following steps:

1. Obtain the code
    
        mkdir translator
        cd translator
        git clone https://github.com/OxfordUAVAutonomy/AgentSpeakTranslator.git

2. As a first step, we recommend to generate the documentation:

        cd src
        make documentation
    
     This steps requires Doxygen (version 1.7.6.1 works). The generated documentation can be accessed via `doc\index.html`, where an example walk-through and a code overview can be found.
    
3. In order to compile the code, do

        cd src
        make
          

## Autopilot

* To generate C code from autopilot in `test/autopilot`, do

        make autopilot
          
    This should generate the following files

        actions.h
        autopilot.c
        autopilot.h
          
    The generated files can be found in `test/autopilot`. These files, together with `types.h` from the same directory, are used in

        catkin_ws/src/tum_ardrone/src/autopilot/autopilotAI/
          
## Troubleshooting

* If you work on Ubuntu 12.04 (e.g., because you use the modified `tum_ardrone` package), you need to install gcc 4.7. This is required because the translator works uses C++11, which requires gcc 4.7, but Ubuntu 12.04 only comes with gcc 4.6. In order to do so, use the following steps (see http://www.swiftsoftwaregroup.com/upgrade-gcc-4-7-ubuntu-12-04/):
        
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7 g++-4.7
        
        sudo update-alternatives --remove gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.6
        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.7 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.7
        sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.6 40 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.6
        
        sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
    
* This code also uses Flex (version 2.5.35 works) and GNU bison (version 2.5 works).
